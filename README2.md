# Currency Hunter

## What’s This About?

You’ll build a simple currency calculator app using React and TypeScript. Users can add or subtract amounts in different currencies, and see the result in a currency they choose.

## Main Features

1. **Inputs**
   - Two number fields (A and B) – only numbers allowed
   - Each has a dropdown to pick a currency
   - Must include these currencies: USD, TWD, JPY, EUR
   - Default currency is TWD for inputs and output

2. **Operations**
   - Let users pick one of these:
     - Add (just numbers, no currency symbol in result)
     - Subtract (just numbers, no currency symbol in result)
     - Add with currency (shows currency symbol in result)
     - Subtract with currency (shows currency symbol in result)

3. **Output**
   - Users pick the output currency
   - Show currency symbols when using “with currency” operations
   - No symbols when using plain add/subvisuals
   - App converts currencies automatically

4. **Exchange Rates**
   - Use this free API for rates: https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/TWD

5. **UI Reference**

## Extra Ideas (Optional)

Feel free to add any of these if you want:

- Make it look nice if you have any idea (with or without a CSS framework)
- Use the right input types
- Show input errors right away
- Add friendly error messages
- Support keyboard shortcuts
- Fix TypeScript warnings
- Make it run faster
- Clean up repeated code
- Any cool ideas you have!

## How We’ll Grade It

We’ll look at:

- If it does all the main stuff
- How it handles errors and weird cases
- How clean and organized the code is
- If it follows good coding habits
- How well TypeScript is used
- If it’s easy and nice to use
